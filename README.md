#Promises and the Fetch API:

now what exactly is a promise and what can we do with it?
So the formal definition of a promise is that it's an object that is used basically as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
And if that sounds weird to you, we can also say that a promise is like a container for an asynchronously delivered value,  promise is a container for a future value. There are two different types of settled promises that's fulfilled promises and rejected promises.So a fulfilled promise is a promise that has successfully resulted in a value just as we expect it.a rejected promise means that there has been an error during the asynchronous task.a promise is only settled once, the state will remain unchanged forever.So we consume a promise, But sometimes we also need to build a promise and to not just consume it.
